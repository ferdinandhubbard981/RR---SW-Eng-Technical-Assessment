# Section C: System Design

In this section, we want to assess your system design knowledge and skill. Please update the `system_overview.md` file with a high-level design of a full-stack robotic system, covering everything from hardware interfaces to the Graphical User Interface. Modify the document as needed to ensure your system architecture is well-defined and clearly structured.
